# FoundLab — AI-Enabled Google Workspace Integration (Documentation)

## Overview
FoundLab helps organizations adopt Google Workspace as an AI-enabled knowledge and operations hub. We integrate Google Workspace core services with Google AI capabilities (including NotebookLM) to structure knowledge, research, compliance documentation, and client-facing reports with clear governance.

## What We Deliver
- Google Workspace domain and tenant setup
- User provisioning, groups, and role-based access control
- Enforced MFA and baseline security policies
- Shared Drives information architecture (Operations / Compliance / Clients)
- Governed enablement of AI tools (e.g., NotebookLM) aligned with Workspace permissions
- Pre-built templates for analysis and reporting (Docs/Sheets/Slides)
- End-user training + operational playbook

## How It Works with Google Workspace
1. **Workspace Setup**: domain verification, DNS (SPF/DKIM/DMARC where applicable), admin baseline.
2. **Identity & Governance**: groups, OUs (if needed), MFA enforcement, permission model.
3. **Information Architecture**: Shared Drives + naming standards + access rules.
4. **AI Enablement**: NotebookLM enabled for approved users/groups; sources are organized in Drive.
5. **Operationalization**: templates + usage guidelines + training to ensure repeatable output.

## Security & Governance (Practical)
- Access control is enforced through Google Workspace Admin Console and group-based permissions.
- Shared Drives reduce data sprawl and standardize access.
- FoundLab operates within the customer’s Workspace tenant and governance model during implementation.

## Use Cases
- Research hub for macro and investment analysis
- Standardized monthly reporting packs (executive summaries and client-facing materials)
- Controlled documentation workflows for compliance and internal policies

## Typical Engagement (5 business days)
Day 1–2: domain/admin, users/groups, MFA, baseline security  
Day 3: Shared Drives + permissions + audit readiness checklist  
Day 4: NotebookLM enablement + notebooks structure + prompt library  
Day 5: pilot output + training + handover runbook

## Example Outcome (Non-confidential)
- Reduced time to produce internal summaries and reports via standard templates and governed AI workflows.
- Improved governance through Shared Drives, permissions, and enforced MFA.
